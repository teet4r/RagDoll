This collection contains 18 different types of cars.

To use them, just drag the prefab into your scene
and just the "Car-Color-Script" to change to color 
of your car.
The script is used for the reason, to put one 
and the same car more than one time into your scene
and give them all different colors without adding
new materials.

A special shader for the main surface and the windows
is also included.

All wheels are single objects parented to the cars to
make it easy to animate them or use them with physic-setups.

The color will be set in the renderer by the script, 
so you will not see the result in the unity editor mode.

Just open the example scene for a simple preview.
